=======
This is a RubyGem installation of Tobias Herzke's [ncurses-ruby][].
It has been modified slightly in various ways, and is intended to continue the
life of the otherwise apparently defunct project.

Since it is now on [GitHub][], feel free to fork and contribute to the project, it
would be much appreciated.

Installation
------------
The simplest way to install this gem is via GitHub's gem repository. First,
you have to add this repository to your RubyGem sources, if you haven't
already:
    
    gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    
Next, you can simply install the gem directly from my repository:
    
    gem install elliottcable-ncurses
    
There have been reports of the gem failing to build on some systems. This will
be investigated in more detail at a later date, but for now, Iâ€™ll provide the
`./configure` line I know to work on my Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard system:
    
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
      --without-cxx --without-cxx-binding --without-ada --without-progs --without-curses-h \
      --with-shared --without-debug \
      --enable-widec --enable-const --enable-ext-colors --enable-sigwinch --enable-wgetch-events \
    && make
    
Contributing
------------
If you're more interested in the project, and desire to work with its sources,
you can clone them using [git][]:
    
    git clone git://github.com/elliottcable/ncurses.git elliottcable-ncurses
    
There are rake tasks for compiling and building the source, using [Echoe][].
You'll need to install it to build and compile this gem:
    
    gem install echoe
    rake package:compile # Compiles the C extensions into lib/
    rake package:package # Packages the RubyGem into pkg/
    rake package:install # Packages the RubyGem and `sudo gem install`s it
    rake -T              # To list other tasks
    
There are no specs as of yet (ncurses-ruby never had any, and I don't
currently have the time to write an entire test suite for this), so I'd ask
that you take the archaic method of making sure whatever you add/change works:
run it/use it in a bunch of different ways. d-:

If you're really awesome, you could write said test suite!
